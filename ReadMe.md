# Programming Challenge Solutions

This repository is intended for personal use as a record of my submissions on various programming challenge platforms.

All I can ask of you is that you please don't just take my solutions for yourself. You will never learn anything this way, and you will be missing out on an opportunity to improve your skills as a developer. Please feel free to review the code in this repo as example solutions or to compare against your own though.
