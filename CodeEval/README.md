# CodeEvalSolutions
These are my solutions for the CodeEval problems I have solved.

I am currently working to solve problems in the following languages:
* C#
* Java
* Python 2.7
* Python 3.4

All I can do is ask this of you, but please don't just take any of my solutions for yourself. You'll never learn anything, and you'll be missing out on a good learning opportunity. Please feel free to use my code as an example though, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions about how/why I solved something the way I did. I'll try to respond when I can.
