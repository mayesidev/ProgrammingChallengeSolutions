Disclaimer:
All I can do is ask this of you, but please don't just take my solutions for yourself. You'll never learn anything, and you'll just miss out on a good learning opportunity. Please feel free to use my code as an example though, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions about how/why I solved something the way I did. I'll try to respond when I can.
